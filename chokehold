When we were made
It was no accident
We were tangled up like branches in a flood
I come as a blade
A sacred guardian
So you keep me sharp and test my worth in blood
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a...
Beneath the stormy seas
Above the mountain peaks
It's all the same to me
It makes no difference
I've seen my days unfold
Done the impossible
I'll turn my walls to gold to bring you home again
So show me that which I cannot see
Even if it hurts me
Even if I can't sleep
Oh, and though we act out of our holy duty to be constantly awake
